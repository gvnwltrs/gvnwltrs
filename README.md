### Lately

Bunch of embedded projects I've been sitting on lately (keeping local -- adding starting 02-04-2025). I'll start sharing more here on projects realted to that, and improving them over time as I go down the rabbit hole 😉. Low-level stuff is great, but need to get even lower. Need to know how the software acutally runs on the hardware, especially for where technology is and where it's heading...🧐

## Of Interest 

Check out https://github.com/gvnwltrs/ros2_webrtc_video_streamer periodically if your into ROS2 video streaming. Could use the help. It's WebRTC based.
